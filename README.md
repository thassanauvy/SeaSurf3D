# 🌊 Sea Surfing Simulator 3D

A minimalistic **3D surfing simulator** that demonstrates core computer graphics techniques.  
Players ride a surfboard across dynamic waves, balancing speed and tilt while enjoying an immersive ocean environment.  

---

## 📖 Project Overview
- A **real-time 3D simulator** with a **low-poly ocean aesthetic**.  
- Focused on **wave dynamics, surfboard physics, shaders, and camera systems**.  
- Built as a graphics-focused academic project (no reliance on heavy game engines).

## 🛠️ Core Features
1. **Surfboard Dynamics** – Tilt, balance, and acceleration on water surface.  
2. **Procedural Waves** – Noise-based wave mesh with real-time movement.  
3. **Camera Suite** – Chase cam, cinematic orbit cam, and wave-level perspective.  
4. **Minimalist HUD** – Displays speed, balance meter, and wave height.  
5. **Atmospheric Effects** – Reflections, spray particles, fog, and sunlight.  
6. **Collision & Wipeout** – Crash if balance is lost or surfboard collides.  
7. **Environment Elements** – Islands, buoys, and birds for realism.  
8. **Soundscape** – Ocean waves, wind, and splash effects.  
9. **Performance Optimisation** – Level-of-detail rendering & frustum culling.

## 🎨 Visual Language
- **Low-poly models** for surfboard, islands, and environment.  
- **Flat-shaded palette** for stylized visuals.  
- **Quiet UI** with minimalist HUD overlays.
